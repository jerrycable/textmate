Title: About TextMate

## TextMate version <script>document.write(TextMate.version)</script>

This is an alpha release which means a few functions are missing but otherwise the program should be reliable and fine for normal use.

The manual is a work in progress and can be found at <http://manual.textmate.org/>. The MacroMates Blog has a [TextMate 2 category](http://blog.macromates.com/categories/textmate-2/).
